# yaticker-esp32

Stock and crypto ticker with different clients (console, cli and web) for esp32 supported screens (such as [LilyGo EPD47](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-EPD47))

# Development

This repo assumes (for now) that you are using a [LilyGo EPD47](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-EPD47) display, which requires you to install a certain number of things:

* Install [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) (on top of vscode). Note: you can also use [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* Install the latest [espressif/arduino-esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) (on Arduino IDE or PlaformIO IDE)
* Install the LilyGo EPD47 library (note - this is done automatically for platformIO)
